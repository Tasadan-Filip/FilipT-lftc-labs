Regex:
 	CheckIfOperator: (\+)|(-)|(\*)|(/)|(==)|(!=)|(<)|(>)|(<=)|(=)|(>=)|(%)
 		Since the operators are "+|-|=|>|<|==|!=|>=|<=|*|**|/|%" this regex checks one by one wheter the token is one of the above strings.
 	CheckIfSeparator: (\[)|(])|(\{)|(})|(;)|\(|\)
 		Since the separators are "[|]|{|}|(|):|.|space|tab" this regex checks one by one wheter the token is one of the above strings.
 	CheckIfKeyword: char|const|for|else|if|int|bool|read|write|var|while
 		Since the keywords are "char|const|for|else|if|int|bool|read|write|var|while" this regex checks one by one wheter the token is one of the above strings.
 	CheckIfIdentifier: [a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*
 		Since each identifier must start with a letter (either capital or lowercase), this regex checks wheter the token starts with at least one letter (this is the meaning of +) and this sequence may be followed by any combination of letters and digits.
 	CheckIfArray: [a-zA-z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*\\[[1-9]+[0-9]*]
 		Since each array must start with a letter (either capital or lowercase), this regex checks wheter the token starts with at least one letter (this is the meaning of +) and this sequence may be followed by any combination of letters and digits, followed by straight brackets [ ] in which there must be a positive non-zero integer number (this is why it checks if between brackets there is at least one digit from 1-9 followed by any number of digits including zero, but an integer number cannot start with 0)
 	CheckIfIntegerConstant: [0-9]|[1-9]+[0-9]*
 		This regex checks wheter the number contains a single digit or if it contains more digits it assures that the first digit is non-zero and it can be followed by any number of digits (including zero)
 	CheckIfCharacterConstant: '[a-zA-Z0-9]'
 		A character constant starts with ' and ends in ' and in between there can be one character which is either a letter (lowercase or uppercase) or a number
 	CheckIfStringConstant: "[a-zA-Z0-9]*"
 		A string constant starts with " and ends in " and in between there can be a variable length sequence of letters (lowercase or uppercase) or numbers
